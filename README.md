## Indicator Notes

- Indicator 1.1 % of coalition participants reporting an improvement in WASH system understanding
  - Data not valid across concept teams because they use different methods, general might be the way to go with this one
  - Could break into three graphs to show change over time within concept team; see what this looks like when broken out by coalition
- Indicator 1.2 # of analyses conducted to improve understanding of WASH systems
  - Overall graph for number of studies over time
  - Look at data for FY 20 and see if we can broadly group by analysis type (or for over time) â€“ this is a task for Laurel and Shawn
- Indicator 1.3 # of stakeholders reached with findings from systems analyses
  - Visually demarcate the concept teams for various geographies
- Indicator 2.1 % of coalitions that have an agreed set of needs and priorities
  - No visualization
- Indicator 3.1 % of SWS geographies showing an improvement in WASH network strength
  - No visualization
- Indicator 3.2 % average rating for each coalition progress markers for their vision of more sustainable services (The one we talked about in our last meeting)
  - Past: average scores of PMs for each concept team
  - Story we want to tell: something more similar to badges to visualize overall progress for each coalition over time; might group expect to see, like to see, and love to see categories
- Indicator 5.1 # of evidence products or activities by SWS partners
  - Show by type (academic, grey, presentation) for reporting period broken out by team

### Deployment

* Make sure app.py includes (after defining variable app)

  ```python
  server = app.server
  ```

* Create Procfile with conents

  ```
  web: gunicorn app:server
  ```

  Note no space after `app:`

* Install gunicorn if not already 

  ```bash
  pip install gunicorn
  ```

  Create requirements.txt

  * `pip freeze>requirements.txt`
  * You can also list the key dependencies in a text file. Should set up a pip or conda environment though.

* Use Heroku to deploy

  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "<message>"
  git push origin master
  heroku create <app name>
  git push heroku master
  heroku ps:scale web=1
  ```

* Data are loaded directly from github repo for this version.
