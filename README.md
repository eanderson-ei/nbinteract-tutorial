  - Data not valid across concept teams because they use different methods, general might be the way to go with this one
  - Could break into three graphs to show change over time within concept team; see what this looks like when broken out by coalition

- Indicator 1.2 # of analyses conducted to improve understanding of WASH systems
  - Overall graph for number of studies over time
  - Look at data for FY 20 and see if we can broadly group by analysis type (or for over time) â€“ this is a task for Laurel and Shawn
